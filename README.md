1. Briefly state how much of the project you completed, e.g. which of the
   sub tasks work.

      I have sucesfully completed the additive identity and mult identity! It was very fun theyve pased the tests I gave it.
      
2. Briefly discuss one thing you learned by completing this assignment that
   you believe will be valuable to you in your future courses / programming experiences.

      I learned about this testing framework, its pretty awesome! I will defiently be using this in probably all my assignments going forward. I have almost always just used a debugger or did print statements and this is just so nice and I like how the file handling thing is.

3. Briefly discuss either one aspect of this assignment you did not enjoy or
   one particular difficult bug you encountered.

      I had some issues visualizing how to do my recursion but once I got ahold of a white board I felt a lot better. The big issue I had was my tree would change and id just keep going down the tree but sometimes I had to recheck the same node if I replaced it with another + 0.
